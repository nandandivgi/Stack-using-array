# Stack-using-array
A stack is a data structure that can be represented as an array. Let us learn more about Array representation of a stack â€“
An array is used to store an ordered list of elements. Using an array for representation of stack is one of the easy techniques to manage the data. But there is a major difference between an array and a stack.
* Size of an array is fixed.
* While, in a stack, there is no fixed size since the size of stack changed with the number of elements inserted or deleted to and from it.

Despite the difference, an array can be used to represent a stack by taking an array of maximum size; big enough to manage a stack.
